# mapfront-end-app


This appplication was created to help users leanr fun facts about different countries in the world. It was one fo the first web development projects that I worked on. I was apart of a fantastic team of three developers who all brainstormed to create this front end application. 

At this time in the bootcamp we only knew of JS, HTML, and CSS to create our application. This was my first project in which I was able to use an api call to get the data I wanted. 

Overall I really enjoyed this project and hope others find it useful for their interests.
